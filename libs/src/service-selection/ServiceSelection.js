/**
 * A class that assists with autoselecting services.
 * `ServiceSelection` is intended to be overridden with further
 * business logic that a particular sevice might preference.
 *
 * The general use case is as follows:
 *
 * ```
 *
 * const selector = new ServiceSelection({
 *   getServices: ethContracts.getDiscoveryProviders()
 * })
 *
 * const service = await selector.select()
 *
 * ```
 *
 * This class operates by taking a list of services and
 * round-robin makes requests at them until a suitable one is found.
 *
 * Two types of "bad" services are defined below:
 *  - Unhealthy: this service is bad and should not be used
 *  - Backup: this service is bad, but if we can't find anything better, maybe use it
 *
 * Classes that extend `ServiceSelection` can choose to implement custom logic on top
 * of them and is generally how this class is intended to be used.
